# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- React Project

-Using Lenis for Smooth Scrolling
  This project incorporates Lenis, a library for smooth and responsive scrolling interactions. Lenis allows you to easily achieve fluid scroll animations with         customizable easing functions and scroll behavior.

-To install Lenis:
  npm install @studio-freight/lenis
  # or
  yarn add @studio-freight/lenis

-After installation, Lenis can be used within the project to provide smooth scroll experiences, including support for handling custom easing, scroll offsets, and more.
-For further details, refer to the Lenis documentation.

-Using GSAP for Animations
  This project also utilizes GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), a professional-grade animation library. GSAP is renowned for its performance, flexibility, and ease of use, allowing for the creation of complex, high-performance animations.

-To install GSAP:
  npm install gsap
  # or
  yarn add gsap

-Once installed, GSAP can be used to animate various elements in your React components, providing smooth and dynamic animations like tweening, timelines, and scroll-based effects.
-For more information, visit the GSAP documentation.
